Deyong Sun have graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology in July 2021, majoring in computational mechanics. Now he is looking for a PhD position in computational mechanics. Recently, he has been awarded as "The Best graduate student in Beijing and BIT" and his master thesis has been chosen as "The excellent graduate thesis".

Unitil today, he has some relative experience in shape optimization and viscoelastic solid propellant and their applications to heterogeneous materials, and his three first-author papers have been published in *Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg (**CMAME**)* and *J. Comput. Appl. Math (**JCAM**)* respectively,
