Steps:

* Simulating the viscoelastic effects of solid propellant by isogeometric boundary element
* Employing Laplace transform and correspondence principle to obtain analytical solutions
* Extending this framework to simulate the fracture and debonding behaviors of viscoelastic\-plastic materials in solid propellant
