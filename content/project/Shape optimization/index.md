Steps:

* Obtained 2D and 3D complexed CAD models from Rhino and reconstructed them by Matlab and Fortran according to basic parameters
* Applied the shape optimization analysis based on the gradient-based optimization method (MMA) to elastic problems
* Applied the parallel computing method with Fortran and OPENMP to improve the computing efficiency
* Implemented Rapid and Direct Algorithm to optimize large scale coating structures
